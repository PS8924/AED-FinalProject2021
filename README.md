#INFO 5100 AED-Final Project 



Description :

Amongst the rising covid-19 cases , it becomes extremely difficult for patients to arrange plasma and the medicines required to fight covid-19.​

Covid-Relief System is an app which will provide users with a platform to donate plasma as well as request plasma during the time of emergency.​

It also provides the functionality to order medicines directly from the pharmacy and get it delivered to them. ​

Moreover, It also helps a covid patient connect to contact  NGO which would raise funds for their overall treatment cost.

#App developed using JAVA swing.
